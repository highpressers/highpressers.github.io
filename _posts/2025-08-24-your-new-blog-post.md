## First Blog Post

Welcome to the first blog by the High Pressers! Obviously in this post, there isnt much to say, but I will go ahead.

Today, I will be talking about the future of Tottenham Hotspur under new manager Thomas Frank. With two wins in two games, the Thomas Frank era has started off wonderfully. Players such as Richarlison seem to be reinvigorated under Frank. So what else can we expect from the Lilywhites this season?

Under Frank, Tottenham have played incredibly well against some of the best teams in the world, examples include PSG and Manchester City.
Frank's pragmatic approach to games has left many fans (including myself) saying nothing but praises for the Dane.

Many expect nothing major of Spurs this season, with a majority of their squad remaining unchanged from the same one that finished
17th in the Premier League last season. However, I, along with many other Spurs fans, are hopeful of a top 5 finish in the league,
as well as a deep run into the Champions League.

How Thomas Frank prioritizes his competitions is remained to be seen, but in my opinion, a strong season in the league will be vital
for the club, after their horrendous league form last season. I also think a deep run in the Champions League (Ro16, QFs) will be enough to prove
that Tottenham are, once again, a top European team.

All in all, this season will be crucial to prove to the rest of the football world that Tottenham Hotspur are a top European club. Underperforming in any competitions will
result in the exact opposite.
